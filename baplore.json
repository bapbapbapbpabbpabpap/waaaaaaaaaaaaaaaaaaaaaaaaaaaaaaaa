{"script":"'Bap. An interesting entity indeed.' \n 'What is this creature supposed to be? It refuses anything relating to it being a cat.' \n 'I'm not a cat.' \n 'Then what is it supposed to be? Cat eyes, whiskers jutting out from the sides, and a cat eared hat.' \n 'But I'm just a person!' \n 'Certainly not human..But this creature insists it is.' \n 'Bap.' It says once its name is mentioned. What does it mean?' \n 'A language from aliens? No, it couldn't be.' \n 'Odd. It's fond of pancakes and attached to a lightbulb they carry around.' \n 'They say it's the sun. What does that mean? The sun is right above our sky.' \n 'There is no data confirming this entity is benevolent nor malevolent.' \n 'Although we will never forget the night this specimen 'Bap' managed to escape the facility.' \n ''Sir, the entity has escaped!' I've heard for weeks straight.' /n 'We still haven't found this 'Bap' yet.'"}
